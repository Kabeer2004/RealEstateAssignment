## **Context**

CapMatch connects institutional lenders to commercial real estate borrowers. We provide dynamic market intelligence for every deal. One of the key features is the "Market Overview" page, where cards display stats (e.g., population growth, job growth, supply pipeline, rent per SF) for a given address.

## **Assignment Objective**

Build a production-grade system that, given any address, dynamically collects and displays data for one specific market card from our Market Overview page. The system should:

-   Take an address as input (e.g., 555 California St, San Francisco, CA)
-   Fetch and aggregate all the data needed to fully populate one *Market Context* card (choose from Population Growth, Job Growth, Supply Pipeline, or Avg Rent PSF)
-   Source all data from credible external APIs or public datasets
-   Output: A deployed full-stack app (backend + frontend) that can, given a list of addresses, instantly generate the Market card for each - graphs, visuals, maps, graphics included.
-   The results for any address should be populated within 30 seconds after the address is entered
-   We will be checking this by giving you a few addresses on a call and verifying that your system generates the full card details for each within the time limit
